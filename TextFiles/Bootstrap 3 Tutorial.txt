They are completely free to use: Browse Themes Browse Basic Templates Bootstrap 5 vs. Bootstrap 3 & 4 This tutorial follows Bootstrap 3, which was released in 2013. However, we also cover newer versions; Bootstrap 4 (released 2018) and Bootstrap 5 (released 2021). Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap; with new components, faster stylesheets, more responsiveness etc. It supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported. The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to JavaScript instead of jQuery. Note: Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes and documentation changes, and it is perfectly safe to continue to use them. However, new features will NOT be added to them. Did You Know? W3.CSS is an excellent alternative to Bootstrap. W3.CSS is smaller, faster, and easier to use.
