Bootstrap 5 vs. Bootstrap 3 & 4 This tutorial follows Bootstrap 4, which was released in 2018, as an upgrade to Bootstrap 3, with new components, faster stylesheetc, more responsiveness, etc. Bootstrap 5 (released 2021) is the newest version of Bootstrap; It supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported. The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to JavaScript instead of jQuery. Note: Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes and documentation changes, and it is perfectly safe to continue to use them. However, new features will NOT be added to them. Bootstrap 4 Basic Template We have created a responsive starter template with Bootstrap 4.
