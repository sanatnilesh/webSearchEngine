UWindsor Mandatory Vaccination Policy for Vendors, General Contractors and Suppliers COVID-19 Daily Self-Assessment & Safe Lancer App The COVID-19 daily self-assessment screening tool found on the Safe Lancer App is required to be filled out every day before you plan on visiting campus. After answering all of the questions and inputting your appropriate confirmation code, you will receive a green (approved) or Red (denied) QR Code (badge). A Green badge will grant you access to campus and is required to be scanned at all campus buildings you enter and some classroom entrances for the purposes of contact tracing. COVID-19 Safety Ambassadors/Screeners may also ask to see your badge, so be prepared to have it available at all times. If you receive a Red badge you are not permitted to come to campus. Please stay home and follow the instructions provided on this page for next steps. The Safe Lancer App can be downloaded visiting the Google Play or Apple App Store. Before completing your next self-assessment, make sure you've updated to the latest version by opening the app and simply tapping the University of Windsor Safe Lancer App banner at the top of the page. Or, to manually update, open the Safe Lancer App and scroll down to select About/Preferences. Scroll down again and select Data Update. Click the Check for Updates button.
