SPSS Tutorial This tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SPSS. Our SPSS tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to write proper SPSS. The aim of SPSS is to provide statistical analysis. Our SPSS tutorial includes all topics of SPSS, such as what is SPSS, SPSS Statistics, Parametric Vs.

Based on the type of question we have, based on the type of variable (Independent variable or dependent variable), and based on the measurement level, we will be able to choose the right test in SPSS. The treatment of data and the choice of the right statistical test depend upon the kind of measure we have taken for the variable.
