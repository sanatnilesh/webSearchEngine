DOWNLOAD3.2.0 (2021-10-12) "Amongst all the panic and horror [of a power outage], I was smiling." - Assaf Morami "The replication in CouchDB is really the killer feature that sets it apart from other databases." - Patrick Wolf "Even if the internet was very bad our databases in the two locations would eventually sync." - Ryan Meredith More User Stories Data Where You Need It Apache CouchDBâ„¢ lets you access your data where you need it. The Couch Replication Protocol is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers. Store your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs. The Couch Replication Protocol lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling offline-first user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval. See the introduction, technical overview for more information, or learn whatâ€™s new in 3.1. Single Node Database CouchDB is a terrific single-node database that works just like any other database behind an application server of your choice. Most people start with a single node CouchDB instance. More demanding projects can seamlessly upgrade to a cluster. Cluster CouchDB is also a clustered database that allows you to run a single logical database server on any number of servers or VMs. A CouchDB cluster improves on the single-node setup with higher capacity and high-availability without changing any APIs. HTTP/JSON CouchDB makes use of the ubiquitous HTTP protocol and JSON data format and is compatible with any software that supports them. CouchDB also works great with external tools like HTTP proxy servers, load balancers. Offline First Data Sync CouchDBâ€™s unique Replication Protocol is the foundation for a whole new generation of â€œOffline Firstâ€? applications for Mobile applications and other environments with challenging network infrastructures. Ecosystem CouchDB is built for servers (from a Raspberry Pi to big cloud installations), while PouchDB is built for mobile & desktop web-browsers and Couchbase Lite is built for native iOS & Android apps. And all of them can seamlessly replicate data with each other. Reliability CouchDB is serious about data reliability. Individual nodes use a crash-resistent append-only data structure. A multi-node CouchDB cluster saves all data redundantly, so it is always available when you need it. Want to Contribute? We welcome your contributions. CouchDB is an open source project.
